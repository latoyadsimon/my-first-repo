â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/latoyadsimon/my-first-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

--------------
first you need to initialize your repository
git init
then 
git status// shows us the files current status, to be staged/committed

//put the files in the staging area
git add .

//commit the changes
git commit -m "your message here

//now that the code has been commited for the first time, we are now ready to push the code up to github

follow the steps on github:
git remote add origin https://github.com/latoyadsimon/my-first-repo.git

we can verify the new origin has been set by:
git remote -v

git branch -M main// this sets our branch name

git push -u origin main // this will push the changes from our local repo to our remote repo that we specified

//you can use git status when you have made changes to see the files that are now untracked, then git diff 
to see the changes you made

// q, if you get stuck in the editor in the terminal

git push origin main// you can use this after the first time setting your origin for the repo


you should be committing frequently and only committing code that works.
This way you can go back to early versions in the future when you come across bugs.
